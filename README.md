# Cogoport-Homepage
Inorder to run the application, git clone the repository from the link provided on the Cogoport platform and then connect to live server after opening it in VS code.


Some of the the elements I found difficult to replicate from the Cogoport Homepage were:
1. The drop-down list that appears when we click on the navigation buttons.

2. Making the navigation buttons responsive i.e, the way the horizontally placed buttons get converted to a vertical arrangement which apperars when the hamburger icon is clicked in mobile and tablet views.

3. Similarly, we also have the navigation buttons in the website footer that open up a horizontal list of links on clicking.
