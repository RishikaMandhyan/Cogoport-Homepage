Inorder to run the application, git clone the repository from the link provided on the Cogoport platform and then connect to live server after opening it in VS code.
A snapshot of the website mode of the replica made is shown below:

Some of the the elements I found difficult to replicate from the Cogoport Homepage were:
1. The drop-down list that appears when we click on the navigation buttons.
2. Making the navigation buttons responsive i.e, the way the horizontally placed buttons get converted to a vertical arrangement which apperars when the hamburger icon is clicked in mobile and tablet views.
3. Similarly, we also have the navigation buttons in the website footer that open up a horizontal list of links on clicking.
